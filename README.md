# AI-Virtual-Mouse
Developed an AI virtual mouse using hand gesture recognition, leveraging MediaPipe's Hands module and OpenCV in Python. The system interprets hand movements to control cursor actions, eliminating the need for physical devices. This project demonstrates the potential of computer vision in creating touchless, intuitive human-computer interactions.
